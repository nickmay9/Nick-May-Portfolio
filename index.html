            <p>
                I'm a graduate of the University of North Florida where I earned my Bachelor's in Electrical
                Engineering and minor in Computer Science. While attending UNF, I was a member of D1 Men's Soccer 
                Program. I played central midfield there and was a key part of the team that brought home the first 
                conference title for the program and earned the program's first birth into the NCAA tournament.
                <br><br>
                After school I started my engineering career at Lockheed Martin. I spent 3 years there as a Systems 
                Integration and Test Engineer mostly working the JASSM cruise missile program.  Most of my job there 
                was spent developing the test stations and test software using C to test the hardware throughout the 
                missile build process.
                <br><br>
                From Lockheed, I stayed in the Defense Industry but changed into a Sales Engineering role with 
                <a href="https://www.aerogear.us/" target="_blank">AeroGear Telemetry</a>. At AeroGear I mostly worked 
                with Telemetry Engineers but we represented companies that ranged from Telemetry, RF Solutions, Flight Termination
                Systems, Data Acquisition Systems, and much more.
                <br><br>
                Outside of work, I love to live a very active lifestyle. I spent the majority of my life up until I was 23 playing
                soccer competetively. Since then I've started to find other things I'm passionate about. I learned how to surf and  
                fell in love with it and now travel the world to surf. I also found crossfit and I am now getting into doing
                triathlon's.
